Gauss
=====

gauss is a scalable, performant, persistent, in-memory data structure server.
It allows massively distributed applications to update and fetch common
data in a structured and sorted format.

Its main inspirations are Redis and Chord/DHash. Like Redis it focuses on
performance, ease of use, and a small, simple yet powerful feature set, while
from the Chord/DHash projects it inherits scalability, redundancy, and
transparent failover behaviour.

This is a fork of "god" database.
